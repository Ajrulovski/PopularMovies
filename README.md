# PopularMovies

This is a project that represents the first stage of a PopularMovies android app, created as a part of Udacity's Android Nanodegree program.

The code queries the themoviedb's API, so if you need to test the code you will need to sign up for an API key.
To use the code, set your API key in the MovieAPISyncTask.java line 36 

String apikey = "MY_API_KEY";

by replacing the MY_API_KEY with your API key.
